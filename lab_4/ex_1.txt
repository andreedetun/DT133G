The files that implement the graph data structure:
	- src/graph/graph.h
	- src/graph/graph.c

The files that implement the bellman-ford algorithm:
    - src/bellmanford/bellmanford.c
    - src/bellmanford/bellmanford.h

The files that implement the list data structure:
    - src/list/list.h
    - src/list/list.c

Tests that were carried out:
	- tests/graph/graphtest.c, tests all the operations within the graph data structure
	- tests/bellman/bellmantest.c, tests bellman-ford algorithm on graphs
	- tests/presentation/presentation.c, is a test that jaoao handed out before we presented our lab.

instructions on how to execute a test to verify the implemented code:
"cmake ." to compile all implementations and tests at once or if cmake is not availible use gcc from comandline to compile individual files.
