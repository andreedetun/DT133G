The files that implement the binarytree data structure:
	- src/binarytree/binarytree.h
	- src/binarytree/binarytree.c

Tests that were carried out:
	- tests/operations/operations.c, tests all the operations within the binarytree data structure
	- tests/sortingproblems/sortingproblems.c, tests a binary tree with data loaded from files (through arguments) that were given in lab 2.
	- tests/presentation/presentation.c, is a test that jaoao handed out before we presented our lab.

instructions on how to execute a test to verify the implemented code:
"cmake ." to compile all implementations and tests at once or if cmake is not availible use gcc from comandline to compile individual files.
